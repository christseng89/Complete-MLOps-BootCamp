# Monitoring and Debugging ML Models

### Why Monitoring Machine Learning Models is Important
// Importance of Monitoring

- Machine learning models are now more frequently employed for critical real-world tasks, ranging from the detection of fraudulent activities to the implementation of automated braking systems in vehicles.

- The responsibilities of machine learning professionals extend well beyond the deployment of a model into a production environment.

- It is important to constantly oversee the performance of these models to guarantee their continued effectiveness when confronted with real-world scenarios.

- Nevertheless, merely adopting 'conventional software monitoring' practices falls short of what's necessary in the context of machine learning systems. 采用传统的软件监控实践在机器学习系统的背景下是不够的。

// Questions to think
- How do we monitor effectively?
- What metrics to choose?
- What tools are available?
