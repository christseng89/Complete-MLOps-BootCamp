# Monitoring and Debugging ML Models

### Why Monitoring Machine Learning Models is Important
// Importance of Monitoring

- Machine learning models are now more frequently employed for critical real-world tasks, ranging from the detection of fraudulent activities to the implementation of automated braking systems in vehicles.

- The responsibilities of machine learning professionals extend well beyond the deployment of a model into a production environment.

- It is important to constantly oversee the performance of these models to guarantee their continued effectiveness when confronted with real-world scenarios.

- Nevertheless, merely adopting 'conventional software monitoring' practices falls short of what's necessary in the context of machine learning systems. 采用传统的软件监控实践在机器学习系统的背景下是不够的。

// Questions to think
- How do we monitor effectively?
- What metrics to choose?
- What tools are available?

### What is Monitoring of ML models & When to Update Model in Production
// Monitoring of Machine Learning Models

- It's important to note that monitoring is NOT a one-time task that can be completed and then forgotten.
- Monitoring entails the ongoing process of observing a deployed model's behavior to assess its 'Performance'.
- Post-deployment monitoring is crucial because machine learning models can deteriorate and malfunction when in active use.

// When to Update the Model in Production?

- To determine the appropriate moment for updating a model in a production environment, it's essential to maintain a real-time perspective that enables stakeholders to Continuously evaluate the model's Performance within the live setting.
- This continuous assessment ensures that the model is operating as anticipated.
- Achieving 'Maximum Visibility' into your deployed model is a necessity for identifying potential issues and their origins before they have a detrimental impact on the business.
